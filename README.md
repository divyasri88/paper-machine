FOPID Controller Analysis for Paper Machine Process
This work is purely simulation-based. All controller parameters and the plant model are defined within the code.
Requirements
- MATLAB (Tested on R2021b and later)
- Control System Toolbox
 `oustaloup` and `fopid_controller` are embedded within the main script.
The code generates a Bode diagram comparing the sensitivity functions using FOPID controllers.
